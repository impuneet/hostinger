Node.js Hosting: Amazing (And Awful) Places To Host Your Node.js App in 2020.
=============================================================================

Compare Node.js Hosting
-----------------------

Used by businesses of all sizes, Node.js is a runtime environment for server-side JavaScript applications. It’s growing because it’s ideal for quickly building scalable, fast web applications. But, not all hosts are Node.js-friendly.

You can run Node.js for free or cheap on a shared server — but you’ll be severely restricted.  VPS and dedicated servers are better options. Look for hosts that let you easily integrate Node.js apps with developer tools and APIs. Check any hosts upgrade policy — Node.js releases new versions, and your environment must be updated.

We’ll discuss each host later in this post, but here’s a summary of the best 5 hosts for Node.js:

1. [A2 Hosting](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/go/a2-hosting/?t=wiht015-v3_&track=WIHT-node-js&tag=node-js)     
2. [Bluehost](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/go/bluehost/?t=wiht015-v3_&track=WIHT-node-js&tag=node-js)
3. [SiteGround](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/go/siteground/?t=wiht015-v3_&track=WIHT-node-js&tag=node-js) – Advanced priority support and Git comes pre-installed
4.  [LiquidWeb](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/go/liquidweb/?t=wiht015-v3_&track=WIHT-node-js&tag=node-js)
5.  [WebHostFace](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/go/webhostface/?t=wiht015-v3_&track=WIHT-node-js&tag=node-js)

How Did We Pick the Best Hosts for Node.js?
-------------------------------------------

To start, we worked through hosts that support Node.js. We sorted hosting plans, selecting those that offered a wide range of developer tools and technical support.

We prioritized hosts that made it easy to deploy, manage and scale your Node.js apps, integrating with Git and Heroku. We scaled down this list, vetting it against customer reviews.

If you want to develop with Node.js, you will need to host to do it on. This article will help you to find the best host for your needs.

What is Node.js?
----------------

Node.js is an **event-driven** JavaScript run time environment and development framework built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

### Server-Side Applications

It can be used to build server-side web applications, and its architecture allows for massive scalability.

In most conventional web server environments, requests are handled as single, discreet events: a request is made to the server, the server does something, and a response is sent back.

### Getting Server Feedback

This makes it difficult to get ongoing feedback, such as a file upload progress bar, or any kind of push notification.

The usual way these things were done was essentially a hack: by sending a series of frequent requests over and over to check on the progress of the process.

**Node.js was invented to provide a different way of handling client-server I/O (input/output).**

Why Use JavaScript on a Server?
-------------------------------

JavaScript was originally designed as a **scripting language** for web browsers. It provides a way to add logic and computation to what is otherwise a document-reading application.

### Javascript Is a Full-Featured Programming Language

However, it is a **fully-featured programming language** and can be used in other contexts as well.

The inventor of Node.js discovered that its I/O handling capabilities (or lack of them), and some of its other characteristics, made it **ideal** for writing an environment capable of asynchronous, _event-driven I/O_.
